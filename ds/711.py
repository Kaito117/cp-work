"""
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones 
representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. 
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
